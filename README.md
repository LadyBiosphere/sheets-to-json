#Google Sheets to JSON
======================
###### Updated: Wednesday the 3rd of May 2017.


### Overview
This project was created to demonstrate an example of a 'live data feed'. The data feed relies on a spreadsheet (Google Sheets) and jQuery to work. It is easy to implement and can be applied to situations where a client needs to update content on their website quickly but isn't code-savvy.

### Resources for creating Live Data Feeds

 provides basic information about using Google Spreadsheet as a source for storing information.

[JSON validator & formatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)
