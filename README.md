#Google Sheets to JSON
======================
###### Updated: Wednesday the 3rd of May 2017.


### Overview
This project was created to demonstrate an example of a 'live data feed'. The data feed relies on a spreadsheet (Google Sheets) and jQuery to work. It is easy to implement and can be applied to situations where a client needs to update content on their website quickly but isn't code-savvy.

### Requirements
To get the most out of this project, you will need to create a spreadsheet on Google Drive (use Google Sheets for this). You should take the time to design, label, and populate your spreadsheet in a meaningful way; it's also a good idea to automate cells to do calculations automatically (if this is relevant to your project).

From a technical point, you should already know HTML markup and basic JavaScript. In particular, you should know how to do the following:
- how to get, and where to insert, the jQuery CDN into your webpage
- how to create HTML classes and ID's
- how to recognise JavaScript errors using your browser's console

### Resources for creating Live Data Feeds

[Google hosted libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)
 provides a range of CDN's, including the latest version of jQuery.

[jquery.com](http://jquery.com/)
 provides excellent documentation about jQuery.

[JSON validator & formatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)
 formats your JSON data into a human-readable format. It allows you to see all the arrays, their structures and their respective names.

[Use a Google Spreadsheet as your JSON backend](https://coderwall.com/p/duapqq/use-a-google-spreadsheet-as-your-json-backend)
 provides basic information about using Google Spreadsheet as a source for storing information.
